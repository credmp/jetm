      Execution timer abstraction.
    </p>

    <p>
      The resolution of a timer strictly depends on the Java VM version and the underlying Operating System.
      Therefore this package introduces several timer implementations that may be used to record execution times.
      By default JETM will try to use the best available timer implementation, however it is possible to define
      the used ExectionTimer implementation at EtmMonitor construction time.
