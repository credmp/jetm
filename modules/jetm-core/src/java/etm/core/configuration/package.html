    </p>

    <p>
      This package contains the several classes that can be used to configure an EtmManager similar to Log4j
      BasicConfiguration or DOMConfigurator. You may use either {@link etm.core.configuration.BasicEtmConfigurator} or
      {@link etm.core.configuration.XmlEtmConfigurator} to configure a globally available EtmMonitor instance that is
      available via {@link etm.core.configuration.EtmManager#getEtmMonitor}.
